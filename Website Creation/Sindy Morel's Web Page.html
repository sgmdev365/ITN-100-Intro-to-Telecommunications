	<li><b> Improved air quality: </b><i> Plants help remove pollutants and toxins from the air, making the air inside your home cleaner and healthier to breathe.</i>
	<li><b> Reduced stress: </b><i> Studies have shown that being around plants can help reduce stress levels and promote a sense of calm and relaxation.</i>
	<li><b> Increased productivity: </b><i> Having plants in your workspace or home office can help increase focus, creativity, and productivity.</i>
	<li><b> Better mood: </b><i> Being around plants can help boost your mood and reduce feelings of anxiety or depression.</i>
	<li><b> Aesthetic appeal: </b><i> Indoor plants can add a touch of natural beauty to any room, making your home feel more welcoming and comfortable. </i>
	</ul>

	<li><i> A well lit room or large window with plenty of natural light</i></li>
	<li><i> Potting soil </i></li>
	<li><i> Clean water </i></li>

	<li><i> Put on your gloves, or not!</i></li>
	<li><i> Fill your first pot halfway with soil.</i></li>
	<li><i> Place your new plant in the pot, make sure she is centered.</i></li>
